## Automated PR Agents

_Tools that connect directly to GitHub/GitLab to review Pull Requests, comment on code, and suggest fixes asynchronously._

_Note: This list is not intended to compare tools; as maintainers of Kodus, we are biased._

- **[Kodus](https://kodus.io)** (⭐ _Maintainer_)  
  An AI code review agent focusing on high-signal feedback. It allows teams to define custom review guidelines (using plain English) to enforce architectural patterns and best practices, reducing noise in the review process.

- **[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai)** Provides line-by-line feedback on pull requests and generates summaries of changes. Features a chat interface within the PR to discuss the feedback with the AI.

- **[Git AutoReview](https://gitautoreview.com)** VS Code extension that reviews pull requests using three AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) to catch bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. Supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket — the only tool covering all three platforms from inside the IDE.

- **[Greptile](https://greptile.com)** An AI engine that indexes the entire codebase to understand context. It focuses on answering complex questions about the repo and reviewing code with full-repository awareness.

- **[Zenable](https://zenable.io)** AI guardrails that learn your team's standards and ensure coding agents follow them. Works across IDE (via MCP), pre-commit, and PR review to catch bugs and security issues in AI-generated code in real-time.

- **[Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/bugbot)** AI-powered PR review that runs automatically to catch real bugs and security issues with a low false-positive rate.

- **[Revieko](https://synqra.tech/revieko)** - Repo-specific architecture drift detection in pull requests (structural risk + hotspots).

- **[Polarity](https://www.polarity.so)** - The First AI QA Engineer which does code review, testing, and long running agent tasks. Understands your entire codebase and code quality, zero fluff comments.

- **[Conclave AI](https://conclave-ai.dev)** - A council of three models (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini) reviews each PR and, with a PRD attached, flags scope drift a diff-only review misses. Includes an autofix worker; self-hostable (FSL).

- **[AI Change Passport](https://github.com/P-r-e-m-i-u-m/ai-change-passport)** - GitHub Action and CLI that creates signed provenance reports for AI-assisted pull requests, helping reviewers see sensitive files, dependency edits, workflow changes, and test coverage signals.

- **[Ejentum agent-teams (adversarial-code-review)](https://github.com/ejentum/agent-teams)** Multi-agent code-review team built on the Ejentum Reasoning Harness. Reviewer agents call `harness_code` and `harness_anti_deception` as agentic tools during the review loop; each call returns a structured scaffold (named failure pattern, executable procedure, suppression vectors, falsification test) the agent reads internally before issuing review feedback. Catches false-confident approvals and sunk-cost framings that single-agent reviewers miss.

- **[Gito](https://github.com/Nayjest/Gito)** - Open-source AI code reviewer for GitHub and GitLab. Runs locally via CLI or in CI/CD pipelines, and works with any LLM provider — including self-hosted models (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM) for fully private reviews.

- **[Ivy Tendril](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Tendril)** - Open-source AI coding orchestrator with automated verification gates (build, test, lint, format, AI review) that enforce code quality before any PR reaches human review. Orchestrates Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Copilot, and OpenCode.
- **[Optibot](https://getoptimal.ai)** - AI code review for GitHub & GitLab that catches production-breaking bugs, business-logic errors, and security issues with line-specific feedback and optional inline fixes. The same engine also ships as a CLI, an MCP server, and a Claude Code skill.

- **[Swarm Orchestrator](https://github.com/moonrunnerkc/swarm-orchestrator)** - GitHub Action and CLI that audits AI-generated pull requests for eleven cheat patterns (relaxed tests, swallowed errors, fake renames, and more). Advisory by default, with an opt-in merge gate.

- **[heygrc](https://heygrc.com)** GitHub App that reviews pull requests against compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, EU AI Act, and more), flags changes that put a control at risk, and says what to fix, citing the control clause.
